# Code of conduct

We follow the [Rust Code of Conduct][rust-coc] with some extra points:

* In the absence of evidence to suggest otherwise, assume good faith when
  engaging with others
* Moderation actions may be taken for behavior observed outside of
  project-specific spaces
* We have limited patience, so violations may skip the warning and directly
  result in a ban
